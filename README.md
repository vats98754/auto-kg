# auto-kg
This app automatically builds (via free locally-hosted LLM calls) and displays (via Neo4j) an interactive knowledge graph of all (inferred) relevant concepts from a set of documents. I want to do this as a cool and hopefully efficient visualization and presentation tool for course notes - may be useful for lazy business people.
