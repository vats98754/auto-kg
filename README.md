# auto-kg
This app automatically builds (via free locally-hosted LLM calls) and displays (via Neo4j) an interactive knowledge graph of all (inferred) relevant concepts from a set of documents. I want to do this as a cool and hopefully efficient visualization and presentation tool for course notes - may be useful for lazy business people. Ultimately I want to deepen my knowledge of statistics, data science, and mathematics (in that order).

I will be starting off by making a hopefully very complete knowledge graph of the study of mathematics scraping data and relations between mathe topics from Wikipedia. I would like anybody to be able to share a link to other for the knowledge graph they created via this tool.
